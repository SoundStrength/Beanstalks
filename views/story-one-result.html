                <p>Well, fasten your seatbelt as this brings you to the lab where you embark on your learning process.</p>
                <p>Physics teaches you about matter, energy and their interactions. It’s not just about maths, motion, astronomy, etc. but it’s also about imagination, passion and love for the unknown. You learn core theoretical concepts but also develop transferable skills such as problem solving and analytical thinking. Next it’s time to focus on a specialty.</p>
